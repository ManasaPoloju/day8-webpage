        <p>In 1934, the International Badminton Federation was created. This organization included Canada, Denmark, France, England, the Netherlands, Ireland, Scotland, New Zealand, and Wales. Under its guidance since 1947, the world badminton championships for men (Thomas Cup) started being held. In 1992, badminton was included in the program of the Olympic Games. Since then, the popularity of badminton has been only growing in the world. It became especially popular in the countries of Southeast Asia. Currently, badminton is dominated by the Asian athletes (China, the Republic of Korea, Indonesia), who win up to 90% of the medals at the world championships.

        <p>At the first serve, the shuttlecock must be hit from the bottom and the racket must not rise above the server's belt. The use of fraudulent and false actions is allowed during such a serving. After serving, the players are free to move around their area, but touching the net is strictly prohibited. The maximum number of games that may constitute a match is three. Each game is won by a player or the team that scores 21 points. With the score of 20-20, one needs to score 2 points, and with a score of 29-29, it is enough to score one point.</p>
        <p>A change of the sides occurs in the following situations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>after the end of the first game</li>
            <li>before the third game (if it is supposed to take place)</li>
            <li>after 11 points in the third game</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Badminton Court Dimensions and Net Height</h1>
        <p>Badminton court has a rectangular shape. The overall dimensions of a badminton court is 20 feet by 44 feet. For a doubles game, the width of the court should be 20 feet. The net is installed at a height of 5.1 feet; the height of the net in the center is 5 (when it is sagging). The net is limited above by a strip of 0.25 feet, which is folded in half.</p>
        <p>Another integral part of the court is the markup. The width of the marking lines is 4 centimeters. At a distance of 6.5 feet from the grid, there is the service line. Between the service line and the back line, there is the service zone. The central line divides the service zone into the right and the left areas.</p>

        <p><u>Badminton racket:</u> Originally, the rackets were made of wood. Modern racquets are made of different materials including carbon fiber, aluminum, steel or titanium. The weight of the racket is approximately 70-100 grams. Most professional players use special wrapping on the racket handle ("grip"), which helps the athletes to achieve the best control while holding the racket.<br> <u>Shuttlecock:</u> There are two types of shuttlecocks: plastic ones and the ones with natural feathers. Plastic shuttlecocks are more suitable for amateurs and some types of training. As a rule, the standard for competitions and training of professional athletes are feather shuttlecocks. A plastic shuttlecock consists of cork or synthetic head and a plastic "skirt" attached to it. The feather shuttlecock is made of 16 goose feathers and a cork head covered with fine husky leather. Feathers are glued into the holes around the circumference of the head. They are tied with thread, and the thread is also glued. The weight of the shuttlecock is about 5 grams.<br> <u>Badminton shoes:</u> Badminton shoes have serious lateral support of the ankle, which prevents the ankles from tucking in with a sharp change of direction and lunges.</p>
